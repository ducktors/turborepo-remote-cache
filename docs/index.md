# Turborepo Remote Cache

This project is an open-source implementation of the [Turborepo custom remote cache server](https://turborepo.org/docs/features/remote-caching#custom-remote-caches). If Vercel's official cache server isn't a viable option, this server is an alternative for self-hosted deployments.
It supports several storage providers and deploys environments. Moreover, the project provides __"deploy to "__ buttons for one-click deployments whenever possible.
