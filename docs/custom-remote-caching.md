# Enable custom remote caching in your Turborepo project

To enable a custom remote caching server in your Turborepo repository, you must
either add a config file by hand or set local environment variables.

## Config file

To enable remote caching, you must configure it by hand. In fact, the `turbo login` and `turbo link` commands work only with Vercel's remote cache.

First, you need to create the config file:

1. Create the `.turbo` folder at the root of your repository
2. Create the `config.json` file inside it, and add this property:
    - `apiurl`: the address of your `turborepo-remote-cache` server.

For example:

`.turbo/config.json`
```json
{
  "apiurl": "http://cache.ducktors.dev"
}
```

Now, you need to configure two additional environment variables, `TURBO_TEAM` and `TURBO_TOKEN`, within your development machine or CI pipeline. There are three ways to do it:

1. Set/export `TURBO_TEAM=ducktors` and `TURBO_TOKEN=myGeneratedToken` as environment variables.
2. Add `teamslug` and/or `token` to the `.turbo/config.json` file. __Note: Including the *token* here is a less secure way to do it if you plan to share or commit the config file. Prefer the TURBO_TOKEN environment variable whenever possible__. For example:

    `.turbo/config.json`

    ```json
    {
      "apiurl": "http://cache.ducktors.dev",
      "teamslug": "ducktors",
      "token": "myGeneratedToken"
    }
    ```
    - Setting the *TURBO_API*, *TURBO_TEAM*, and/or *TURBO_TOKEN* environment variables will __override__ the `apiurl`, `teamslug`, `token` properties of this file, respectively.

3. Modify your project `package.json` scripts by adding the `--team=yourTeam` and `--token=yourToken` parameters. __Note: This is a less secure way to do it because the token is committed inside the repository. Prefer the other two whenever possible.__

For example:

`package.json`
```jsonc
//...
  "build": "turbo run build --team=\"ducktors\" --token=\"myGeneratedToken\"",
  "dev": "turbo run dev --parallel",
  "lint": "turbo run lint",
  "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{ts,tsx,md}\""
//...
```

__Note: The token value must be the same as for your server's `TURBO_TOKEN` env var. See the [environment variables](https://ducktors.github.io/turborepo-remote-cache/environment-variables) section for more info.__


## Enable remote caching in Docker
To enable remote caching in Docker, you must pass `TURBO_TEAM` inside Dockerfile as [build arg](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/build-args/) and `TURBO_TOKEN` as [build secret](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/secrets/) if you have *not* included them within `.turbo/config.json` or added them as parameters within `package.json` (see *Config file* above).

For example:

```Dockerfile
ARG TURBO_TEAM
ENV TURBO_TEAM=$TURBO_TEAM

ARG TURBO_TOKEN
ENV TURBO_TOKEN=$TURBO_TOKEN

COPY turbo.json ./
COPY .turbo/config.json ./.turbo/

RUN --mount=type=bind,source=.git,target=.git \
    --mount=type=secret,id=TURBO_TOKEN \
    TURBO_TOKEN=$(cat /run/secrets/TURBO_TOKEN) pnpm turbo build
```

and build your image leveraging Remote Cache Server with this command:

```sh
# TURBO_TOKEN is an env variable preferably set from CI secrets
docker buildx build --progress=plain \
    --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    -f Dockerfile . \
    --build-arg TURBO_TEAM="ducktors" \
    --secret id=TURBO_TOKEN,env=TURBO_TOKEN \
    --no-cache
```

## Local environment variables

You can also configure your development machine by setting the following environment variables instead of using the config file:

| Variable      | Type   | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `TURBO_API`   | string | The address of a running `turborepo-remote-cache` server |
| `TURBO_TEAM`  | string | The team (see *Config file* above)|
| `TURBO_TOKEN` | string | Your secret key. This must be the same as the `TURBO_TOKEN` variable set on your turborepo-remote-cache server instance |

**Note: these environment variables are used by the Turborepo CLI** on the development machine or CI pipelines. They are not used by the `turborepo-remote-cache` server.

## Artifact Integrity and Authenticity Verification

Turborepo can sign artifacts with a secret key before uploading them to the Remote Cache. This increases the security of your remote cache by having Turborepo verify the integrity and authenticity of artifacts when they are downloaded. Any artifacts that fail verification will be treated as a cache miss.

To enable this feature, first update your turbo.json file to include the signature property:

`turbo.json`

```json
{
  "remoteCache": {
    "signature": true
  }
}
```

Next, you need to provide a secret key as an environment variable to both your Turborepo client (in your CI/development environment) and the turborepo-remote-cache server.

| Variable      | Type   | Description |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY | string | A secret key used to sign and verify remote cache artifacts. Must be the same for the Turborepo client and the cache server.|

```
