# Supported Storage Providers

## AWS Credentials and Region

AWS credentials and configuration are loaded as described in the AWS SDK documentation:

- [Setting Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html)
- [Setting Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-region.html)

For example, you can set environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or create a file
`~/.aws/credentials` with AWS credentials.

Specify the region using the `AWS_REGION` environment variable, or in `~/.aws/config`.

## Configure Google Cloud Storage
1. Create a [bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) (or use an existing one)
1. Create a new [service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) with a role of `Storage Object Viewer` and `Storage Object Creator`.
1. Click "Create Key" and save the JSON file.
1. Add the `project_id` , `client_email`, and `private_key` from saved JSON file to `.env` (or wherever you manage your environment variables):
  ```sh
  # .env
  STORAGE_PROVIDER=google-cloud-storage
  STORAGE_PATH=<name-of-the-bucket>
  GCS_PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
  GCS_CLIENT_EMAIL=<client_email>
  GCS_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>
  ```
